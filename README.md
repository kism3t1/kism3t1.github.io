## Building and previewing your site locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.

### Modify the GitHub Actions workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys your site to Github Pages is defined by the `pages.yml` file. You'll need to edit this file to that so that your build and deploy steps look to your `docs` directory, rather than the project root.

1.  Set the default `working-directory` param for the build job.

    ```yaml
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      defaults:
        run:
          working-directory: docs
    ```

2.  Set the `working-directory` param for the Setup Ruby step.

    ```yaml
    - name: Setup Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.3'
          bundler-cache: true
          cache-version: 0
          working-directory: '${{ github.workspace }}/docs'
    ```

3.  Set the path param for the Upload artifact step:

    ```yaml
    - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: docs/_site/
    ```

4.  Modify the trigger so that only changes within the `docs` directory start the workflow. Otherwise, every change to your project (even those that don't affect the docs) would trigger a new site build and deploy.

    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - "main"
        paths:
          - "docs/**"
    ```
